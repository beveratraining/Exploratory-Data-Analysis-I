## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Markdown Syntax
Markdown is simple plain text, that is styled using special characters, including:

` #`: a header element.
**: bold text.
*: italic text.
` : code blocks.

You can run code chunks:

Line-by-line: With cursor on current line, Ctrl + Enter (Windows/Linux) or Command + Enter (Mac OS X).

By chunk: You can run the entire chunk (or multiple chunks) by clicking on the Chunks dropdown button in the upper right corner of the script environment and choosing the appropriate option. Keyboard shortcuts are available for these options.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#There are three parts to an .Rmd file:

#Header: The text at the top of the document, written in YAML format.
#Markdown sections: Text that describes your workflow written using markdown syntax.
#Code chunks: Chunks of R code that can be run and also can be rendered using knitr to an output document.

3 Common Chunk Options: Eval, Echo & Results
eval = FALSE: Do not evaluate (or run) this code chunk when knitting the RMD document. The code in this chunk will still render in our knitted html output, however it will not be evaluated or run by R.

echo=FALSE: Hide the code in the output. The code is evaluated when the Rmd file is knit, however only the output is rendered on the output document.

results=hide: The code chunk will be evaluated but the results or the code will not be rendered on the output document. This is useful if you are viewing the structure of a large object (e.g. outputs of a large data.frame which is the equivalent of a spreadsheet in R).
Multiple code chunk options can be used for the same chunk.

```{r output_pdf}
# Open pfd file
# Customizing the output

```{r lineplot}
#R base functions: plot() and lines()
#The simplified format of plot() and lines() is as follow.

#x, y: coordinate vectors of points to join
#type: character indicating the type of plotting. Allowed values are:
  #"p" for points
  #"l" for lines
  #"b" for both points and lines
  #"c" for empty points joined by lines
  #"o" for overplotted points and lines
  #"s" and "S" for stair steps
  #"n" does not produce any points or lines
#lty: line types. Line types can either be specified as an integer (0=blank, 1=solid (default), 2=dashed, 3=dotted, 4=dotdash, 5=longdash, 6=twodash) or as one of the character strings "blank", "solid", "dashed", "dotted", "dotdash", "longdash", or "twodash", where "blank" uses 'invisible lines' (i.e., does not draw them).
